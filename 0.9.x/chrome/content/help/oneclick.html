<h2>What is &quot;dTaOneClick&quot;?</h2>
<p>dTaOneClick! will start downloading all the links/pictures of the current webpage that will match the filters used  in the last dTa! session. Downloads will be saved in the last setted destination path and will be renamed using the last setted renaming mask.</p>
<p>For example, open dTa! right clicking in a free spot of a gallery page, select inclusive filter "Images" from "Make your selection" window and click on Start!. dTa will download all the pictures linked in the webpage, but it will also remember all the settings for the next time. Now browse another gallery. Right click on a free spot and just select "dTaOneClick!". Boom. You'll have all the pictures downloaded in your download folder. In one click.</p>
